# Getting Started : http://cng-management.surge.sh

1. Product Background : 
    
    Management has never been an easy job, especially with the management of a brick
    warehouse. With normal management on paper or excel, it will be difficult to manage all of them
    because Managers will have to design a template for export orders, and statistical tables with excel
    skill requirements as well. If there is a data error, it will take a long time to trace back. And its
    interface is also difficult to use and get used to in a short time.
    From those ideas, my team found that they could create a brick warehouse management
    website with functions to help overcome the above cases and with a management website that will
    help users access anywhere on the internet. and accounts in the system without having to depend
    on storage devices.
    As a project guide for her group, she is also managing the brick warehouse for her husband.
    Our group asked for permission to make a website to manage and statistics brick warehouses to
    replace the current management method with excel she is applying. The team has been approved by
    her and allowed to do the project and she will hold the position of the customer who sets the
    requirements for the group.

2. Business Opportunity :
    
    With this brick warehouse management project, we focus on developing deep into the brick
    product. That will help increase business opportunities in brick management networks with brick
    dealers than in multi-product management with no product code.

    Brick is a frequently used product and it has many different parameters. Being able to manage
    those parameters accurately will help the project get more attention from brick dealers.
    With the initial purpose of being a multi-warehouse based management project that will help
    reach more potential customers, they manage bricks in many different places.
    Important tasks such as import and export of bricks or statistics of inventory profits and
    liabilities will be maximized to help it be both easy to use and convenient for users.
    It is important to be able to help users (here Ms. Nang) save more time in managing her husband's
    brick warehouse.

3. Software Product Vision : 
    
    With the application of creating an easy-to-use user interface, Ms. Nang will be able to manage
    the brick warehouse more easily.
    With the features of automatic calculation, statistics, daily reports and can be exported to files
    for storage, it will make the job of profit and inventory statistics simpler. The system allows users to
    review past profit statistics from which they can evaluate and compare, thereby providing business
    strategies for the coming future.

4. Project Scope & Limitations :  
    
    The scope is applicable to brick distributors, not to stores that sell many products other than bricks.
    Management of basic objects related to brick warehouses are: brick warehouse, employees,
    customers, import and export orders of bricks, brick products and include income sales statistics,
    inventory and profit.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
